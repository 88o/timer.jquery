timer.jquery is a simple timer plugin for jquery. It shows a text based timer inside a div or span or any other valid HTML element.
Currently it has only 3 methods as of now, start, pause and resume.

TODO: enable a functionality to initialize the timer with a number of seconds or a time format like 03:20:10
